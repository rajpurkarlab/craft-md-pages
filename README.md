# CRAFT-MD

CRAFT-MD is a robust and scalable evaluation framework designed to assess the conversational reasoning capabilities of clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios, going beyond traditional accuracy metrics derived from exam-style questions. The framework simulates doctor-patient interactions, where the clinical LLM's ability to gather medical histories, synthesize information, and arrive at accurate diagnoses is evaluated through a multi-agent setup. This setup includes a patient-AI, a grader-AI, and validation by medical experts to ensure the reliability of the results.
